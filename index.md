## Currently

Research fellow the Centre for Research on Engineering Software Technology ([CREST](https://www.crest-centre.net)) at the University of Adelaide, conducting research in the [DLT Cluster](http://dlt.crest-centre.net). My research focuses on ensuring the trustworthiness of the information processed and exchanged by a community of rational agents, without relying on a trusted third party. I am interested in decentralised and trustless software systems as well as design frameworks and tools to support their development.
